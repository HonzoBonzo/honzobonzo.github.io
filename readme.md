Create an angular app which will simulate countries list like this:
http://prnt.sc/c94suy

Find CORS API which will return list of all countries with continents.

Countries should be grouped by continents.

There should be a possibility to sort countries and enable/disable them (checkbox)
When you click on checkbox near continent it should disable/enable all countries for the continent. 

When all countries of continent are selected the continent checkbox should be checked, otherwise unchecked.

In terms of any questions feel free to find your own solutions and do as you understand.
